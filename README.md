## Project Description
    It is a simple real estate auction app that allows users to view a list of properties for sale all over the world. It also allows users to log in their own properties that are up for sale.

## MVP
#### As a User I can:
    1. See a list of properties up for sale on the Home page of the application.

    2. Click on a single property and view its full details on a new page.

    3. I can get place a bid on a property by clicking the 'Bid' button and submitting my new price on a form.

    4. If I am a user who wishes to sell my property, I can do so by filling in the form on the 'Form Page' and adding my property to the list of properties up for sell.

    5. I can also delete my logged property by clicking the 'DELETE' button.
